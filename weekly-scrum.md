# Weekly Scrum

This is an optional side-activity to help students stay in contact and follow their progress. 

*** 

## What is Scrum? 

* Scrum is one of the largest fundamental practices that occur in an agile scrum process. This is like a scrum meeting also called stand-up meeting 
* In real life, it could be a short 15-minute round-table discussion which ensures the entire development team is up to date
* At *etki_JS Remote Code Camp*, we will do a text-based weekly scrum in which students can answer some questions on Slack (like what you’ve done, what are you doing next and if you need help with something)

## Why do this? 

For 3 reasons:

1) To help students stay on track and be in sync with other students learning the same things 
2) To assist if they get stuck  
3) To gain experience with one of the most used team collaboration techniques in the real world! (yes, this can actually help when interviewing for jobs!) 

## How does it work? 

Every Monday we’ll post a message on channels #Level1 and #Level2 asking students to answer 3 questions: 

1. What did you get done last week? (any accomplishments?)
2. Any blockers where you need help?
3. What are you getting done this week?

## Any examples?

Students can choose to answer something like this: 

**Level1**:  
1. Continued with the Responsive Web Design Certification
2. Flexbox was a bit complicated to me, is there any other good source that explains this better?
3. I want to finish this one and get started with the JS Algorithms and Data Structure 

**Level2**:  
1. Finished Part2 
2. Yes! I struggled with array methods on exercise 2.1
3. Finish Part2 and start working on Part3 

## Moving forward

This activity could be extended to an optional *video* Weekly Scrum in which a host and students could meet through Zoom for about 30 min and respond to these 3 questions. 
To be determined depending on students' interaction and through Poll results if there's a need for it.
