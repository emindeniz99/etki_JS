### A History Lesson
Tetris is a puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984. Pajitnov derived its name from combining the Greek numerical prefix tetra- (the falling pieces contain 4 segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport.

### About scoring system
The scoring formula is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear is worth 40 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a Tetris) is worth 1200.

A level multiplier is also used. The game starts at level 0. The level increases every ten lines you clear. Note that after increasing the level, the total number of cleared lines is not reset.

### Task
Calculate the final score of the game using original Nintendo scoring system

### Input
Array with cleaned lines.
Example: [4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2]
Input will always be valid: array of random length (from 0 to 5000) with numbers from 0 to 4.

### Ouput
Calculated final score.
`def get_score(arr) -> int: return 0`

### Example
`get_score([4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2]); # returns 4900`

- Step 1: +1200 points for 4 lines (current level 0). Score: 0+1200=1200;
- Step 2: +100 for 2 lines. Score: 1200+100=1300;
- Step 3: +100. Score: 1300+100=1400;
- Step 4: +300 for 3 lines (current level still 0). Score: 1400+300=1700.
- Total number of cleaned lines 11 (4 + 2 + 2 + 3), so level goes up to 1 (level ups each 10 lines);
- Step 5: +600 for 3 lines (current level 1). Score: 1700+600=2300;
- Step 6: +2400. Score: 2300+2400=4700;
- Step 7: +200. Total score: 4700+200=4900 points.
